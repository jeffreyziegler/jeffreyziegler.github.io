<br/><p>
Participants that complete online surveys and experiments may be inattentive, which can hinder researchers’ ability to draw substantive or causal inferences. As such, many practitioners include multiple factual or instructional closed-ended manipulation checks to identify low-attention respondents. However, closed-ended manipulation checks are either correct or incorrect, which allows participants to more easily guess and it reduces the potential variation in attention between respondents. In response to these shortcomings, I develop an automatic and standardized methodology to measure attention that relies on the text that respondents provide in an open-ended manipulation check. There are multiple benefits to this approach. First, it provides a continuous measure of attention, which allows for greater variation between respondents. Second, it reduces the reliance on subjective, paid humans to analyze open-ended responses.  Last, I outline how to diagnose the impact of inattentive workers on the overall results, including how to assess the average treatment effect of those respondents that likely received the treatment. I provide easy-to-use software in R to implement these suggestions for open-ended manipulation checks.

<br/><p>
Democracies are thought to violate treaties less frequently than non-democracies, yet democracies violate bilateral investment treaties (BITs) more often. Though democratic governments may intend to meet their international obligations, and though democratic institutions provide greater political constraints to encourage compliance, investment agreements may conflict with the goal of maintaining domestic public support. Specifically, we argue that credible elections create strong incentives for governments to side with domestic voters over foreign business interests, and to pass legislation that violates investment agreements. We use a data set of BIT violation complaints that better captures potential indirect expropriation to confirm prior findings that show a difference in violations by regime type. Importantly, however, governments are only more likely to violate BITs as credible elections approach. The results suggest that the ability of voters to sanction leaders is an important mechanism that incentivizes governments to potentially violate investment treaties through indirect expropriation.

<br/>
One of the more important innovations in the study of how citizens assess the U.S. Supreme Court is the ideological updating model, which assumes that citizens grant legitimacy to the institution according to the perceived distance between themselves and the Court on a unidimensional ideological (liberal–conservative) continuum. Under this model, citizens are also said to update this calculation with every new salient Supreme Court decision. The model’s requirements, however, do not seem to square with the long-established view that Americans are largely innocent of ideology. Here, we conduct an audit of the model’s mechanisms using a series of empirical tests applied to a nationally representative sample. Our general conclusion is that the ideological updating model, especially when supplemented with the requirement that citizens must become aware of Court decisions, simply does not square with the realities of American politics. Students of Supreme Court legitimacy may therefore want to search for other theories of legitimacy updating.

<br/><p>
Are leaders responsive to their followers’ political preferences over time even when formal accountability mechanisms, such as elections, are weak or absent? I argue that unelected leaders have incentives to be responsive because they rely on dedicated members for legitimacy and support. I test this theory by examining the Catholic Church and its unelected leader, the pope. First, I analyze over 10,000 papal statements to confirm that the papacy is responsive to Catholics’ concerns. Second, I conduct survey experiments using nationally representative samples of Catholics in Brazil and Mexico to investigate how Catholics react to responsiveness. Catholics increase their organizational trust and participation when they receive papal messages that reflect their concerns, conditional on their existing commitment to the Church and their agreement with the Church on political issues. The evidence suggests that even in organizations without elections, leaders reaffirm members’ political interests because followers support organizations that are responsive.

<br/><p>
A growing theoretical literature identifies how the process of constitutional review shapes judicial decision-making, legislative behavior, and even the constitutionality of legislation and executive actions. However, the empirical interrogation of these theoretical arguments is limited by the absence of a common protocol for coding constitutional review decisions across courts and time. We introduce such a coding protocol and database (CompLaw) of rulings by 42 constitutional courts. To illustrate the value of CompLaw, we examine a heretofore untested empirical implication about how review timing relates to rulings of unconstitutionality (Ward and Gabel, 2019). We first examine this relationship with a set of national constitutional courts in one year. We then conduct a more nuanced analysis of rulings by the French Constitutional Council over a 13-year period. Our data analysis highlights the benefits of CompLaw for scholars of judicial review.

Numerous cross-sectional studies confirm the long theorized association between mothers’ depression and lower parenting self-efficacy (PSE) beliefs.  However, cross-sectional studies leave unanswered the direction of this association: Does depression predict PSE? Does PSE predict depression? Are both true? Does the strength of the association between depression and PSE, regardless of the direction, generalize across participant characteristics and study design features? How stable is PSE over time? And how effective are interventions at enhancing PSE? To answer these questions, we conducted a meta-analytic review of longitudinal studies. With 35 eligible studies (22,698 participants), we found support for both models: there was a significant pooled effect of both depression on PSE and of PSE on depression, with nearly identical effect sizes (d = -0.21 and -0.22 respectively). The association was stronger in samples with mothers’ younger average age and studies that measured PSE among mothers relative to during pregnancy. We found a medium degree of stability in the index of PSE, d = 0.60. Finally, the estimated pooled effect size between being in an intervention group versus control group and PSE was 0.505. Overall, support for bidirectional associations between depression and PSE in mothers, along with our findings of the stability of PSE over time yet strong evidence for being modifiable with intervention, suggest the importance of continuing to develop, test, and disseminate interventions to enhance PSE. We interpret these findings in the context of both depression and PSE having been found to have serious consequences for child outcomes and maladaptive parenting.

Miller, David R. & **Jeffrey Ziegler**. ”Preferential Abstention in Conjoint Experiments”.
<br/>
<details><summary> Abstract </summary>
<br/><p>
Social scientists increasingly use conjoint experiments to mimic political decisions that ordinary people face, such as selecting news stories or voting for public officials. Conjoint designs, however, do not always mirror the real-world decisions that individuals make because respondents are forced to select only one of two options and cannot abstain. First, we show through simulations that allowing respondents to abstain can yield different average marginal component effects (AMCEs) depending on the (1) reference category of comparison and (2) variation in respondents’ "cost" to select one of the alternatives. Second, we demonstrate empirically how omitting a realistic abstention option leads to over- and under-estimation of the AMCEs by replicating two conjoint experiments. We provide an online application to help practitioners explore how forcing respondents to express a preference when none exists may impact the results of their conjoint experiment.
